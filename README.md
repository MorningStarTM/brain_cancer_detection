# Brain Tumor Classification

This project focuses on the development of a deep learning model for brain tumor classification. The goal is to accurately classify brain tumor images into different categories, such as glioma or meningioma or pituitary or notumor using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. 

# Actives
* Dataset Collection: A dataset of brain tumor images is collected from kaggle. The dataset consists of 4 types of tumor such are  glioma, meningioma, pituitary and notumor images, ensuring a diverse representation of brain tumor cases.


* Data Preprocessing: The collected dataset is preprocessed to prepare it for training. This includes tasks such as resizing images and normalizing pixel values.

* Model Selection: Different deep learning architectures, such as ResNet, VGG and custom model are evaluated for their performance on the brain tumor classification task. The model selection process involves training and evaluating these models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

* Model Training: The chosen deep learning model is trained on the preprocessed dataset.The aim is to achieve high accuracy and generalization on unseen brain tumor images.

* Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using  evaluation metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix. The model's performance is assessed on a separate test dataset to measure its effectiveness in classifying brain tumor images.
